**vasco** is a Postgres extension that helps you discover hidden
correlations in your data. 
It is based on the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_information_coefficient) and
the [MINE family of statistics](http://www.exploredata.net).

Consider the following table for example:
   
```tsql
CREATE TABLE vasco_data
AS (SELECT RANDOM()                          AS rand_x,
           RANDOM()                          AS rand_y,
           x                                 AS x,
           x                                 AS ident,
           4 * pow(x, 3) + pow(x, 2) - 4 * x AS cubic,
           COS(12 * PI() + x * (1 + x))      AS periodic
    FROM GENERATE_SERIES(0, 1, 0.001) x);
```

With vasco you can compute the MIC score between any pair of columns.
Strongly-correlated variables will get a score closer to 1.

```tsql
SELECT MIC(x, ident),
       MIC(x, rand_x),
       MIC(x, cubic),
       MIC(x, periodic)
FROM vasco_data;
```

```
 mic |        mic        |        mic        | mic | mic 
-----+-------------------+-------------------+-----+-----
   1 | 0.150372685226294 | 0.129610387112352 |   1 |   1
(1 row)
```


```tsql
SELECT mic(X, Y) -- vasco: detects any association between columns.

SELECT corr(X,Y) -- standard Postgres: detects linear associations only.
```

## Usage

Let's start by populating Postgres with some stock price data for the S&P 500.

```shell
psql -f demo/stocks.sql postgres
```

A `v_sample` view that contains daily closing prices for FAANG and a few other tickers is now available.
We want to explore which of these stock prices are correlated and how strong that correlation is.

### Correlation Pairs

The **Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC)** measures how strong is the
association between a pair of variables (columns).
For our example, we can compute this by using the `mic(x,y)` aggregate function for each pair of stocks we're interested
in.

Let's pick some arbitrary pairs and compute the MIC for them.

```sql
select mic(aapl, nflx)  as aapl_nfxl,
       mic(aapl, googl) as aapl_googl,
       mic(aapl, ba)    as aapl_ba,
       mic(ba, pg)      as ba_pg,
       mic(pg, gm)      as pg_gm
from v_sample
```

| aapl_nfxl | aapl_googl | aapl_ba | ba_pg | pg_gm |
|:----------|:-----------|:--------|:------|:------|
| 0.51      | 0.80       | 0.55    | 0.48  | 0.32  |

We can see that Apple's stock price is strongly correlated with Google's,
while with Netflix's, not so much.
The correlation strength between Procter & Gamble (PG) is not really associated
with Boeing's (BA) price.

### Exploring a table

To exhaustively explore the correlations between all stock pairs in a relation we can do it in one go:

```sql
select vasco_corr_matrix('v_faang', 'mic_v_faang')
```

This will compute the MIC for all column pairs in `v_faang` and store
the correlation matrix as a new table `mic_v_faang`.

| col   | aapl | meta | amzn | googl | nflx |
|-------|------|------|------|-------|------|
| aapl  | 1.00 | 0.63 | 0.51 | 0.81  | 0.52 |
| meta  | 0.63 | 1.00 | 0.72 | 0.64  | 0.80 |
| amzn  | 0.51 | 0.72 | 1.00 | 0.58  | 0.80 |
| googl | 0.81 | 0.64 | 0.58 | 1.00  | 0.47 |
| nflx  | 0.52 | 0.80 | 0.80 | 0.47  | 1.00 |

Here's a plot of this correlation matrix as a heatmap

### Additional Metrics: Exploring the association

No algorithm can magically detect the function of the relationship
between two variables, but MINE statistics can shed some light into the
nature of that relationship.

| Metric                                          | SQL Function               | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum Asymmetry Score (MAS)                   | `SELECT mas(X, Y)`         | measures how much the relationship deviates from monotonicity                                                                                                 |
| Maximum Edge Value (MEV)                        | `SELECT mev(X, Y)`         | measures the degree to which the dataset appears to be sampled from a continuous function.                                                                    |
| Minimum Cell Number (MCN)                       | `SELECT mcn(X, Y`)         | measures the complexity of the association.                                                                                                                   |
| Minimum Cell Number General (MCNG)              | `SELECT mcn_general(X, Y)` | returns the MCN with `eps = 1 - MIC`                                                                                                                          |
| Total Information Coefficient (TIC)             | `SELECT tic(X, Y)`         | returns the total information coefficient                                                                                                                     |
| Generalized Mean Information Coefficient (GMIC) | `SELECT gmic(X, Y)`        | generalization of MIC, which incorporates a tuning parameter that can be used to modify the complexity of the association favored by the measure [Luedtke2013] |


### Choosing an estimator

There have been proposed a number of algorithms to estimate the MIC.
Currently, in **vasco**, you can choose between `ApproxMIC` from
Reshef2011 or `MIC_e` from Reshef2016 .

``` sql
SET vasco.mic_estimator = ApproxMIC
SET vasco.mic_estimator = MIC_e
```

### Configuration parameters

The following MINE parameters can be set via GUC.

- `vasco.mine_c`
- `vasco.mine_alpha`
- `vasco.mic_estimator`
- `vasco.mine_mcn_eps`
- `vasco.mine_tic_norm`
- `vasco.mine_gmic_p`

## Installation

``` bash
cd /tmp
git clone git@github.com:Florents-Tselai/vasco.git
cd vasco
make all
make install # may need sudo
```

Then in a Postgres session run

``` sql
CREATE EXTENSION vasco
```

## Next Steps

- Try out ChiMIC [Chen2013] and BackMIC
- Currently `M` is re-computed every time a function score is called.
  That\'s a huge waste of resources. Caching `M` or sharing it between
  runs should be the first optimization to be done.
- A potential next step would be continuously updating the CM as
  columns are updated (think a trigger or bgw process).
- Make an extension for SQLite and DuckDB as well
- Build convenience functions to create variable pairs and explore
  tables in one pass.

## Thanks

For MINE statistics, **vasco** currently uses the implementation
provided by Albanese2013 via the [minepy](https://github.com/minepy/minepy) package.

Alternative implementations are coming up.
